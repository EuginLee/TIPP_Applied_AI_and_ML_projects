This project is a collaboration between Nvidia and Republic Polytechnic (RP) as a capstone project for the Tech Immersion and Placement Programme (TIPP) programme by Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).

# Goal
- The goal of this project is to provide an annotation tool, to differentiate key takeaways in a corpus of text. 
- The summarisation technique will be powered by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models. 

# Brief
- Development environment - Windows 8 / Windows 10
- Streamlit and Flask
- Python
- Transformer
- Newspaper3k
- Tensorflow
- Pytorch


# To run ( you need to run 2 instances of python):  
  
1) Set up the flask server:
python extractiveServer_flask.py  
  
2) Run streamlit:
streamlit run extractiveUI_streamlit.py
  
NOTE: 1 and 2 are running 2 instances of python.
