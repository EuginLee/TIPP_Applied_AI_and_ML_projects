# ANN Deep learning classification using Keras  

Deep learning is a branch of Unsupervised Machine Learning which uses different types of neural networks.  
  
Using the Sonar dataset, the project develops an ANN model to classify 60 sonar readings to 2 classes: Rocks and Mines.  

Python skills: Keras, Scikit-learn, deep learning neural networks
