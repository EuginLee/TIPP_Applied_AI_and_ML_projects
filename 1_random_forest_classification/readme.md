# Loan Prediction: classification problem set  
## Model: Random Forest Classification
Test score: 0.77  
Analysis: feature importance selection (select key features of dataset)  
Fine tuning: GridSearchCV    
  
  
## 1) Random forest classification model
The random forest model uses random sampling and bagging (bootstrap aggregation) to reduce correlation between the trees and increase diversification.

In addition, it outputs simple feature selection which is useful when "explaining" the model to non-data science stakeholders
