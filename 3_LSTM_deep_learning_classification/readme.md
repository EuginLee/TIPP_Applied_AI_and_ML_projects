# LSTM prediction/classification using Keras and Google Colab

 LSTM (Long short term memory) is a variant of RNN (Recurring Neural network) that remembers past data using a memory cell feature. 
 Use cases ranges from predicting time series datasets and Natural Language Programming (NLP).
 
 In this project, we use a RNN(LSTM) model to predict if the room is occupied in the next minute.

 We introduce data lead/lag, to predict if room is occupied in the next time instance.

Skills: keras, scikitlearn, pandas, numpy, google colab, neural networks
