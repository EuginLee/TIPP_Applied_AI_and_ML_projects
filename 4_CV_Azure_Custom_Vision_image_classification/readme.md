# Computer Vision: Image classification using Azure Custom Vision, cloud solutions
We train a CV model using birds images and use it to identify other birds in production.  
Grade A / Test score: 80%  
  
Data preprocessing:  
Organising birds images by its individual type and storing it in separation folders to facilitate cloud upload.  
Use data manipulation techniques, such as greyscale, rotate images, contour to improve model performance.  
  
Training model:  
Create an MS Azure account(if you haven't)  
Upload images into Azure custom vision and train model  

Python application:  
Fit the model into a python workflow/pipeline  
For production, we created a python application command line UI
